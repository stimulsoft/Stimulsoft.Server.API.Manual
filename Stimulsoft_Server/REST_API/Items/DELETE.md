## DELETE

**Description**:

Removing an element from the current workspace. However, the use of this command does not guarantee the immediate removal of the element from a tree, because the command only creates an internal task of server to delete the item and the actual deletion may be delayed for some time.

A custom header x-sti-SessionKey contains the session key of the current user. A custom header x-sti-AllowMoveToRecycleBin allows deleting an item to the recycle bin, by default it is set to true. To remove an item with referenced resources set x-sti-AllowMoveToRecycleBin to false. The itemkey parameter in the URI is the key of item and indicates the item whose data you want to delete.


**CURL example**:

curl -X DELETE -H "x-sti-SessionKey: ea8cc765d54241e18347a043e187ada3" -H "x-sti-AllowMoveToRecycleBin: false" http://reports.stimulsoft.com/1/items/ca3bfa74c8114b3a83fd08c04ab31f99
